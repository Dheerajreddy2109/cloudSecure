            You’ve seen the headlines about multi-million-dollar breaches. Useful as a cautionary tale, but not for budgeting. 
            If you’re a ~50-person company, here’s a straightforward way to estimate impact.

          <h2>The four buckets of cost</h2>

          <h3>1) Downtime</h3>
          <p>
            What does an hour of outage cost you? Add lost revenue + paid salaries for idle teams + penalties/SLA credits 
            (if applicable). Multiply by realistic downtime (even a day or two is common if backups aren’t clean).
          </p>

          <h3>2) Recovery & cleanup</h3>
          <p>
            Forensics, incident response hours, overtime for IT, new hardware, and time to rebuild systems. 
            If backups were exposed, assume more time and cloud costs.
          </p>

          <h3>3) Business impact</h3>
          <p>
            Delayed deals, churn from spooked customers, and potential price concessions to keep accounts. 
            Even one slipped quarter hurts small companies.
          </p>

          <h3>4) Legal & communications</h3>
          <p>
            Outside counsel, notifications, credit monitoring (if PII involved), PR support, and time spent with insurers.
          </p>

          <h2>A quick back-of-the-napkin model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Hourly burn (salaries + overhead for the org): estimate a blended rate × number of employees affected.</li>
            <li>Revenue at risk: average daily bookings × days delayed.</li>
            <li>External help: set a placeholder for IR/forensics (many providers offer retainers; that saves money during an emergency).</li>
            <li>Customer impact: estimate churn or discounts on your top 10 accounts if data is involved.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This won’t be perfect, but it gives you a number to compare against preventive spend like EDR, backups, and 24/7 monitoring.

          <h2>What actually moves the needle before a breach</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>MFA and SSO: prevents the majority of straightforward account-takeover incidents.</li>
            <li>EDR + logging: turns “we think something happened” into “here’s what happened and when.”</li>
            <li>Immutable backups: snapshot retention with tested restores.</li>
            <li>Least privilege: reduce blast radius when credentials leak.</li>
            <li>Runbooks + practice: people freeze without a script. Tabletop once a quarter.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Insurance is not a plan</h2>
          <p>
            Cyber insurance can help, but it’s not instant recovery. Most carriers now require MFA, EDR, and basic hygiene 
            to issue or renew a policy. Treat it as a financial backstop, not a substitute for controls.
